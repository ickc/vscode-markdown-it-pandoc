This repo is forked from https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-markdown-emoji acted as a template for creating a [markdown-it extensions in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/markdown-extension#adding-support-for-new-syntax-with-markdownit-plugins). Hence it already has an MIT license by Microsoft.

`extensions.js` is adapted from <https://github.com/mb21/markdown-it-pandoc/blob/master/index.js>. So the recommendation from [Altering author names in MIT license](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/386584/380079) is followed to combine the authorships.
